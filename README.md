# Indoor UAV assignment Docker

This is the indoor uav docker that should be used for assignments related to integration. 

## Contents

    Ubuntu 20
    ROS Noetic
    PX4 Software in the loop (with depth camera)
    Gazebo Classic
    AWS small house world

## How to use

    1. ./build
    2. ./attach to run and attach
    3. ./scripts/run to run the simulation (inside docker)

There is no bashrc file inside the docker, so the run script does all the sourcing necessary to run all the scripts.

The source files should be inside assignment/src and properly built/sourced.

Feel free to add dependencies on the docker build if they are necessary for the task.

Don't forget: We should be able to run the assignment easily, so please document all changes and all steps necessary to run the deliverables.
